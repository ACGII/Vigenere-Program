# Vigenere-Program
Assignment: Multiple Languages
Finally, it is time to expand your program so that it can crack messages in other languages.
To accomplish this, you need to write two new methods and modify two methods you have
already written.
Specifically, you should do the following:

● In the VigenereBreaker class, write the public method mostCommonCharIn , which has
one parameter—a HashSet of Strings dictionary . This method should find out which
character, of the letters in the English alphabet, appears most often in the words in
dictionary. It should return this most commonly occurring character. Remember that you
can iterate over a HashSet<String> with a foreach
style for loop.
  
● In the VigenereBreaker class, write the public method breakForAllLanguages , which
has two parameters—a String encrypted , and a HashMap, called languages , mapping
a String representing the name of a language to a HashSet of Strings containing the
words in that language. Try breaking the encryption for each language, and see which
gives the best results! Remember that you can iterate over the language.keySet()
to get the name of each language, and then you can use .get() to look up the
corresponding dictionary for that language. You will want to use the breakForLanguage
and countWords methods that you already wrote to do most of the work (it is slightly
inefficient to recount
the words here, but it is simpler, and the inefficiency is not
significant). You will want to print out the decrypted message as well as the language
that you identified for the message.

Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data

● Modify the method breakForLanguage to make use of your mostCommonCharIn
method to find the most common character in the languageand pass that to
tryKeyLength instead of ‘e’.

● Modify your breakVigenere method to read many dictionaries instead of just one.
○ In particular, you should make a HashMap mapping Strings to a HashSet of
Strings that will map each language name to the set of words in its dictionary.
Then, you will want to read (using your readDictionary method) each of the
dictionaries that we have provided (Danish, Dutch, English, French, German,
Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) and store the words in the HashMap you
made. Reading all the dictionaries may take a little while, so you might add some
print statements to reassure you that your program is making progress.
○ Once you have made that change, you will want to call breakForAllLangs ,
passing in the message (the code to read in the message is unchanged from
before), and the HashMap you just created.
Test your program on the file athens_keyflute.txt . Notice that the correct key “flute” {5, 11, 20,
19, 4} is detected for English, French, Danish, German, and Dutch, due to ‘e’ being the most
common character and the languages having cognates, but English has the greatest number of
valid words for its decryption.
